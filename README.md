# LibreLingo-ISV-from-EN

Interslavic course for English speakers

Everything in this course was hand made. It even contains courses that are hidden in the spanish example course. Please contribute to the course, so more people can learn about Interslavic and LibreLingo!

## Todo
- create and improve grammar lessons for basic a1
- create a python script that makes it easy to create new moduls by just putting phrases in interslavic in it (it should be translated to english automatically) and putting new interslavic words into the new words section with their respective translation
- plan a fully fledged A1 course on the base of word lists like that [one](https://github.com/ginschel/interslavic_crash_course)
- make additonal exercises to practice the words with new phrases like in Duolingo
- create an app image of it (LibreLingo can compile courses to apps which gives us opportunities to get it to the app store)

I mean it will be a bit of work but I hope that when enough people from the Interslavic community gather to improve upon this course we will have the first Interslavic A1 course app which will be a beautiful milestone for Med≈æuslovjansky jezyk/Interslavic and simplify the learning process for most people!
